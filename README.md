## Using docker compose for database server

Docker compose is a good tool to make running a mssql server on osx/linux even easier.

The official mssql-server docker image is cumbersome to set up manually each time it is needed. Working with dotnet in a unix environment (linux, OS X etc) often requires you to have a local database server for development.

Many steps done with docker commands to run a container can be configured in 

docker-compose.yml file instead.  Docker is the engine behind everything. Docker-compose is more like a conductor for the orchestra - making sure each player plays it part in harmony with the rest.



| Configuration parameter | Value          |
| ----------------------- | -------------- |
| server                  | localhost      |
| port                    | 1433 (default) |
| User                    | sa             |
| Password                | S3cr3tPassword |
| Database name           | DATABASE       |



## Start the database server

| What to do                           | How to do it                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Start the database server            | `docker compose up`             |
| Stop the database server             | `docker compose down`           |
| Remove all data from database server | `docker compose down --volumes` |



## Import data to database

- Step 1:  Find the container id with [`docker ps`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/) 
- Step 2: Copy the sql-file to the container ([`docker cp`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/))
- Step 3: Execute the file with `sqlcmd`,  from inside the container ([`docker exec`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/))



### Step 1 Find the container id with [`docker ps`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/) 

After your database container is running, type `docker ps` in your terminal, it will display a list of all running containers and their ids:

> `> docker ps`
>
> ```bash
> CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                 COMMAND         CREATED    STATUS     PORTS                    NAMES
> 
> 78d5fffabbb9  microsoft/mssql-server-linux:latest  "/opt/mssql/bin/sqlsâ€¦"  17 hours ago  Up 7 minutes  0.0.0.0:1433->1433/tcp, :::1433->1433/tcp  student_db_1
> ```

The containerid is in the first column, and in this case is: `78d5fffabbb9`



### Step 2: Copy the sql-file to the container ([`docker cp`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/))



`docker cp database.sql 78d5fffabbb9:/`



### Step 3: Run the sql statements 

Now you will do two things:

1. Open a shell inside the container with `docker exec`
2. Run a command from inside the container that imports the data to the database.



#### 1. Open a shell  inside the container.

```bash
docker exec -ti 78d5fffabbb9 bash
```

#### 2. Import data to database

Run this command, expected result is displayed further down.

```bash
/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P S3cr3tPassword -i database.sql 	
```

Expected result:

```bash
root@78d5fffabbb9:/# /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P S3cr3tPassword -i database.sql 
Changed database context to 'master'.
Changed database context to 'DATABASE'.

## Connect to database from application

**Connectionstring**

```sql
"Server=localhost;Database=DATABASE;User Id=sa;Password=S3cr3tPassword"
```
